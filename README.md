# interaction-tracker

## Introduction
Motivation for this project: disease surveillance inspired by robotics/autonomous driving techniques to track the spread of coronavirus.
## Goals
## Hackathon requirements
## Related works

### Trajectron++
* Formal input and output of network?
* Input to scene representation graph builder?
* How do they visualize? 
* What is the reference frame of each agent? Are these then projected onto a ground plane for visualization purposes? 

## Technical components/ tasks

1. Train Trajectron on NuScenes (Divya)
2. Write inference code - pytorch (Ching Lam)
3. Algorithm to consume output of Trajectron++ network and construct scene representation (graph) (Art)
4. Visualization (if time permits)

## Plan of action
### Division of labor
### Timeline
Deadline: March 16th 5pm PST
